# Text-Summarization-using-LLMs-T5-Transformer-Model-with-Python

## Overview
A text summarization model takes a long text and creates a shorter version while preserving its main points. It works by extracting key sentences directly (**extractive summarization**) or rephrasing the content into a shorter form (**abstractive summarization**).

This project demonstrates how to build a **Text Summarization Model using Large Language Models (LLMs)** with Python. The implementation uses the **T5 Transformer model** by Google, which performs various text-based tasks like translation, question answering, and summarization.

## Project Description
To build a text summarization model, we use the pre-trained **T5 model**. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Model Selection** – Choose a pre-trained model like T5-small, T5-base, or T5-large depending on computational capacity and performance needs.  
2. **Tokenization** – Convert input text into tokens that the model can process.  
3. **Text Summarization** – Generate summaries using beam search and adjust parameters like maximum length and length penalty for better results.  
4. **Decoding** – Convert the generated tokens back into readable text.

This model can generate concise, contextually accurate summaries from long text passages, making it suitable for document summarization, news aggregation, and information retrieval applications.
