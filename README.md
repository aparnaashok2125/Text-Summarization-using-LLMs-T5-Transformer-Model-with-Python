# Text-Summarization-using-LLMs-T5-Transformer-Model-with-Python


Overview

A text summarization model takes a long text and creates a shorter version while preserving its main points. It works by either:

Extractive Summarization: Selecting key sentences directly from the original text.

Abstractive Summarization: Rephrasing and generating new sentences to summarize the content.

If you want to learn how to build a text summarization model using Large Language Models (LLMs), this project demonstrates a simple and effective approach with Python.

Project Description

This project implements a Text Summarization Model using the T5 Transformer, a pre-trained LLM developed by Google.
It converts long input text into concise summaries while maintaining the core meaning.

The process includes:

Selecting a pre-trained model (T5).

Tokenizing the input text into numerical form for the model to process.

Generating the summary using beam search and length penalty for better quality.

Decoding the model output back into human-readable text.

Steps Involved
Step 1: Select a Suitable LLM

Choose a pre-trained model designed for text generation tasks.
The T5 model (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is ideal as it handles multiple NLP tasks such as summarization, translation, and question-answering.

Step 2: Install Required Libraries

Install the Hugging Face transformers library which provides access to various pre-trained models and tokenizers.

pip install transformers

Step 3: Load the Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer

Use the T5Tokenizer and T5ForConditionalGeneration classes from the Transformers library.
Select a model version based on your system capabilities:

t5-small: Fast and lightweight

t5-base: Balanced between accuracy and performance

t5-large: More accurate but computationally heavy

Step 4: Prepare the Text for Summarization

Prefix the input text with "summarize:" to indicate the summarization task to the T5 model.

Example:

text = "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the global economy..."
input_text = "summarize: " + text

Step 5: Tokenize the Input

Convert the text into a sequence of tokens that the model can understand.
Limit the input size with max_length to avoid truncation issues.

Step 6: Generate the Summary

Use the model’s generate() method to create the summary.
Important parameters include:

max_length – Maximum number of tokens in the output

num_beams – Controls beam search (higher = better quality, slower)

length_penalty – Penalizes overly long summaries

Step 7: Decode and Display the Summary

Convert the generated tokens back into readable text using the tokenizer’s decode() method.



This project demonstrates a complete, step-by-step approach to building an abstractive text summarization model using LLMs.
